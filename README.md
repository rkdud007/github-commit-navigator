### why

You know.. sometimes I just want to stalk how other people built some project from scratch, just revisit the initial commit, and enjoy the art of the project getting mature time by time. And i was a bit lazy to clone the repo and also was a bit lazy to browse commits one by one. So yes this is for lazy people who want to enjoy the art of committing history -- enjoy!
